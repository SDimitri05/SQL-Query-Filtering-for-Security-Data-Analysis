# SQL Query Filtering for Security Data Analysis.

Applied Complex SQL Filters to Investigate Login Attempts and Employee Data.

Executed targeted SQL queries using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` operators to analyze security-related datasets within a large organizationâ€™s `employee` and `login_attempts` tables. Developed filters to identify failed login attempts after hours, suspicious activities by date and location, and department-specific employee data. This project enhanced my ability to retrieve precise information from large datasets, sharpened my skills in queryoptimization and data investigation, and contributed to proactive security monitoring and incident response.
